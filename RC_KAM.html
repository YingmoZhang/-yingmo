							<h3>Prelude</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
                            During this month, we were actually approaching the end of the <a class="hl" href="G_PDE.html">Graduate Partial Differential Equations</a> reading course. 
                            However, due to Professor Thierry Laurens' absence from campus for 
                            conferences and other commitments, we were unable to begin the next phase. As a result, I decided 
                            to explore and study more about nonlinear PDEs on my own (I believe learning more is always beneficial). 
                            Eventually, I found a topic that intrigued me which is the Weak KAM theory and PDEs. I am also very grateful to 
                            Professor <a class="hl" href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~laurens/index.html">Thierry Laurens</a>, and after he returned to 
                            campus, I consulted him about some of the questions that arose during my reading over the past month.

							<h3>Synopsis</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
                            First I started from the material 2 by learning the Legendre transform (Chpater 1), then moved to material 1 and
                             studied the Weak KAM theory from the perspective of PDE based on this material. This included some 
                            aspects of dynamical systems, Calculus of variations, and Hamiltonian dynamics. My focus was on the 
                            Lagrangian approach to Weak KAM theory and the nonlinear PDE methods, particularly the application of 
                            the Lax&#8211;Oleinik semigroup, the Weak KAM theorem, viscosity solutions, Mather set and its relation to 
                            Hamiltonian dynamics, and the further analysis of important properties of Weak KAM theory through PDE methods.
