						<h2>Graduate Partial Differential Equations</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<h3>Details</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							<b>Duration:</b> May 16th-August 22nd, 2024<br>
							<b>Reference</b> <i>Partial Differential Equations, Second Edition</i>, Lawrence C. Evans<br>
						</p>
						<header>
							<h3>Synopsis</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Direct Study program was conducted in the summer of 2024 under the supervision of <td><a class="hl" href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~laurens/index.html">Prof. Thierry Laurens</a></td>.
							The primary reference we employed was the second edition of <i> Partial Differential Equations</i> by Lawrence C. Evans. 
							Over a period slightly exceeding three months, we commenced our studies with four fundamental types of equations:
							 the transport equation, the Laplace equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation. Subsequently, we elected 
							 to delve deeper into the wave equation and certain dispersive equations featured in this tome.

							We thoroughly covered all chapters pertinent to the wave equation, with particular emphasis on the newly 
							introduced chapter on nonlinear wave equations in the second edition of Evans' textbook. 
							We judiciously omitted chapters less germane to our objectives. Where necessary, 
							Professor Thierry Laurens furnished me with exercise problems to bolster my comprehension.
							
							In summation, over the course of this slightly more than three-month period, I have theoretically 
							acquired a proficient toolkit for solving wave equations.

							<h3>Notes</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							<strong>This note is still under constructing, I believe there will be a final version soon. </strong>
							During this period, I also composed a set of notes based on Evans' textbook to aid my understanding, 
							review, and quick reference of concepts. These notes can be accessed
							<a class="hl" href="PDF_Files/PDE_Analysis.pdf">here</a>.
