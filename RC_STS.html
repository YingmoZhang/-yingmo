						<h3>Details</h3>

							<b>Duration:</b> June - August, 2024<br>
							<b>Reference</b> <i>Translation Surfaces and Theirs Orbit Closures</i>, Alex Wright<br>

							<h3>Synopsis</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							This is also a Directed Study Program, distinguished by its resemblance to a reading group, conducted under the supervision of
							<td><a class="hl" href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~apisa/">Prof. Paul Apisa</a></td>. 
							The reading material covers concepts from algebraic topology, including homology, cohomology, relative homology, and the 
							strata of Moduli Spaces; it also incorporates ideas from algebraic geometry, such as algebraic varieties and manifolds, 
							as well as dynamics in geometry, including Teichmüller space and Teichmüller flow. Our primary reference was a 
							<a class="hl" href="PDF_Files/StonyBrookSurvey.pdf">survey</a> authored by 
                            Alex Wright,which focuses on topics such as translation surfaces and their dynamics. 
							Over the course of approximately two months, we meticulously studied the first four 
							chapters of this survey and engaged in several exercises provided by Alex Wright to reinforce and 
							expand upon the material.
                            This endeavor ultimately facilitated my first Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), 
                            details of which can be found in <td><a class="hl" href="research.html">here</a></td>.

							<h3>Notes</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I'm always reminding myself to refine and consolidate my notes and get them uploaded, but I never seem to have the time to do so. I think maybe one of my future vacations when I have some free time I'll try to start.						</p>
